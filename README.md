## Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a heart failure patient will survive (`DEATH_EVENT = 0`) or not (`DEATH_EVENT = 1`) based on clinical data.

Heart failure is a serious condition, and early prediction can help doctors provide better treatments.  
By using **machine learning classification models**, I can analyze patterns in medical data and improve decision-making.

I compare **three classification models**:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression**

The best-performing model is **Logistic Regression** in terms of overall metrics.  
However, since Recall is the most important metric in this case, Random Forest performed just as well as Logistic Regression, both achieving a recall score of 0.79.  
Therefore, Random Forest is also a strong candidate.

## ðŸ”¬ Model Training Process

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   - Handle missing values (if any)
   - Normalize numerical features

2. **Feature Selection**

   - Analyze feature importance using correlation heatmaps
   - Remove unnecessary or redundant features

3. **Model Training**

   - Train three classification models: **Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression**
   - Use **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - ROC-AUC for final model selection
